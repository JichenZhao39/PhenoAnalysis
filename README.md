# PhenoAnalysis
Description: 
  Tools for working with and analyzing PhenoCam imagery. Also includes tools for working with satellite imagery (Landsat). This is a work in progress. Most code at this point is still under development. Note this repository is split between matlab and python code, as most initial work was done in matlab. Matlab code is meant to serve more as a reference, as Python will be the language of choice moving forward. 
  
Dependencies:

  1) Requires the PhenoCam toolkit (https://github.com/tmilliman/phenocam_toolkit)
  
  2) The Python tools require the following packages: numpy, scipy, gdal, and pandas (linux systems using apt can obtain these packages using ```sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-gdal python-pandas```)
